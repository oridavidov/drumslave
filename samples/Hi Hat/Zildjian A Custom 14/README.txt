These samples were obtained via http://freesound.org.  These sounds are part of the "High-Quality-Cymbals" pack uploaded by ltibbits, and the "High Quality Acoustic Percussion Samples" pack uploaded by pjcohen.  See http://www.freesound.org/packsViewSingle.php?id=889 and http://www.freesound.org/packsViewSingle.php?id=2902 respectively.

Comments by Wyatt:
Both of these sample packs are using the same cymbals: in this case, a Zildjian A Custom Hi Hat.  However, some of the samples sound better in one pack, and others in the other pack.  I picked and chose the best samples from both.

The Bow Tight and Splash samples came from pjcohen; the rest came from ltibbits.
